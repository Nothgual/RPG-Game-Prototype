Saving Mechanics:
-4 journal entries (save files)
-When one of the journal entries is selected, the players can read the current objective, blurbs, and the in-universe date
 when the entry was written by the Main Character. 

Party Interaction Mechanics:
-Have it so that initiating this menu UI system would bring up a new screen that would accommodate four characters and also emulate the setting in which the system was initiated. For example, if I 
   initiate the system in a castle's hallway, then the screen would show a larger area that has sort of murky art that sort of looks like a castle hallway. This would be similar to how battles work in a standard
   RPG (ours included). When a battle is started, the screen shows an area that looks like the area in which the battle started. This is also flawed because it'd be disorienting, but I think it could be cool.

Proposed Deadline for the Prototype:
-February 14, 2015
